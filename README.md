<h1>IO - ultimate javscript form data control and validation</h1>

<p>Web forms make the web an interactive place, and drive business centric applications. Giving your users and
clients an awesome and easy web form expierence shouldn't be difficult, and it doesn't have to be. Using IO you
can easily build efficient self updating forms (think google docs) or simply save resources by limiting data
communication to strictly updated data. Easily provide matching criteria for inputs and auto-toggle error messages
and the ability to ask IO if the form has an error.
You can also prevent major hair loss by having it in your toolkit the next
time your boss asks you to build up a new screen with lots of data pieces.</p>

<h2>Get me the data!</h2>
<p>Get a containers data:</p>

```javascript
var data = IO.get('.data-wrapper');
```
